Simple Step, fixed axis, fault propagation folding
Algorithm from Stuart Hardy and Josep Poblet (1995): Marine and Petroleum Geology 12, 165-176

Instructions:

1. In Matlab change directory to the fixedAxis folder

2. In the Matlab command window type fixedAxis (fault propagation folding without growth strata), or fixedAxisGrowth (fault propagation folding  with growth strata). OBSERVATION: Growth strata only works for the case of regional subsidence greater or equal to crestal uplift

3. Follow the input windows and watch the fault propagation fold grow

The script psFixedAxis plots the propagation to slip ratio as function of ramp angle
