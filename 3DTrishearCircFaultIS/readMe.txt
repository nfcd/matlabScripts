These are pseudo-3D forward trishear models of a propagating listric thrust, or two propagating listric thrusts of opposite vergence. Thrust slip decreases linearly along strike.

Folding behind the fault is achieved through inclined shear, and folding ahead the fault by trishear with the simplest linear velocity field. This is similar to Cardozo and Brandenburg (2014), but in this case a series of closely spaced sections all parallel to the slip direction are integrated to make a pseudo-3D model.

Instructions:

1. In Matlab cd to the 3DTrishearCircFaultIS folder.
2. Type runModelL for a single listric thrust from the left.
3. Type runModelLG for a single listric thrust from the left and growth strata
4. Type runModelLR for two opposite listric thrusts.
5. Type runModelLRG for two opposite listric thrusts and groth strata.

In 2 to 5, follow the default input panels (press Okay in all panels the first time). Wait for the program to finish. It will plot the final geometry of the beds and the thrust in 3D.
