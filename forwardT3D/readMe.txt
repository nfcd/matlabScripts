True 3D forward trishear fault propagation folding
Algorithm from Cristallini et al. (2004): GSA Bulletin 116, 938-952

Instructions:

1. In Matlab change directory to the forwardT3D folder

2. In the Matlab command window type runmodel

3. Follow the input windows and wait for the program to plot the final 3D geometry of the fold

NOTE: Slip should be positive for reverse faults, and negative for normal faults. The P by S is positive in both reverse and normal faults
