2D forward trishear fault propagation folding with a circular fault and parallel shear in the backlimb. The maximum central angle of the fault is entered by the user. Beyond that, the fault propagates at a constant dip angle.

Trishear velocity from Zehnder and Allmendinger (2000): Journal of Structural Geology 22, 1009-1014

Instructions:

1. In Matlab change directory to the forward folder

2. In the Matlab command window type trishear (trishear folding without growth strata), or trishearGrowth (trishear folding  with growth strata). Notice that trishearGrowth (growth strata) only works for the case of regional subsidence greater or equal to crestal uplift (no erosion on crestal uplift)

3. Press Okay in each one of the input windows and after that watch the structure develop

NOTE: Slip and slip increment should be positive for reverse faults, and negative for normal faults. The P by S is positive in both reverse and normal faults
