2D forward trishear fault propagation folding

Algorithm from Zehnder and Allmendinger (2000): Journal of Structural Geology 22, 1009-1014

Instructions:

1. In Matlab change directory to the forward2D folder

2. In the Matlab command window type trishear (trishear folding without growth strata), or trishearGrowth (trishear folding  with growth strata). OBSERVATION: Growth strata only works for the case of regional subsidence greater or equal to crestal uplift

3. Follow the input windows and watch the trishear fold grow

NOTE: Slip and slip increment should be positive for reverse faults, and negative for normal faults. The P by S is positive in both reverse and normal faults
