Simple Step, Mode I, Fault Bend Folding
Algorithm from Stuart Hardy (1995): Journal of Structural Geology 17, 1785-1788

Instructions:

1. In Matlab change directory to the faultBendFolding folder

2. In the Matlab command window type fabefo (fault bend folding without growth strata), or fabefoGrowth (fault bend folding  with growth strata). OBSERVATION: Growth strata only works for the case of regional subsidence greater or equal to crestal uplift

3. Follow the input windows and watch the fault bend fold grow
