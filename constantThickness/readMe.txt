Simple Step, constant thickness, fault propagation folding
Algorithm from Stuart Hardy (1997): Journal of Structural Geology 19, 893-896

Instructions:

1. In Matlab change directory to the constantThickness folder

2. In the Matlab command window type constantThickness (fault propagation folding without growth strata), or constantThicknessGrowth (fault propagation folding  with growth strata). OBSERVATION: Growth strata only works for the case of regional subsidence greater or equal to crestal uplift

3. Follow the input windows and watch the fault propagation fold grow

The script psConstantThickness plots the propagation to slip ratio as function of ramp angle
